# Google Books Search

## Description
Create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
